# MCHOSE M HUB RISC-V family: experimental support (2026-10-02)

Owner request: "yellow" support for every MCHOSE model we can. This record
covers group A of the [family survey](MCHOSE_FAMILY_SURVEY_2026-10-02.md)
(WCH RISC-V, base 0x5000): every board on the same design as Jet 75 II now
runs on the Jet 75 II backend (protocol 29). The ARM group (Mix87 III design)
and the new-core group (Ace 68 GT, Turbo 16K) are tracked separately.

Not included: Ace 60 (`41E4:2101`, ARM, different build), every ARM board
(Mix87 III design: Ace 68 III / Air III / Air 2 / V2 III / Turbo 8K, Ace 75 8K),
Ace 68 GT and Turbo 16K (new core), and catalog models without an image.

## Evidence per image (static, official M HUB images)

Script `.local/research/mchose-mhub-20261002/verify_group_a.py`
(output `verify_group_a.json`) compares each image with Jet 75 II 1.16:

- `04` / `05` handlers: 16/16 normalised instructions identical in all images.
- `03`: stores the reply length; version halfword + `Mmm dd yyyy` + `,` +
  `hh:mm:ss` (22 bytes) in every image.
- `06` writer: reloads the active profile (stride 64) into config RAM; the
  service gate is exactly reload destination + 7 in all 11 images. New
  generation reloads 64 bytes, older (Jet 75 I, Ace 68 I, Ace 60X I, Mix 87 I)
  32 bytes, which still include byte 7. Reboot rule: settings byte 0 bit 0 for
  Jet 75 II, Zero75X and Ace68-II; otherwise only when profile byte 4's low
  nibble changes, which the one-bit write never does.
- Readers of config byte 7: bit 3 is tested only by the A0 service in every
  image; other readers test bits 1 and 2.
- A0 report: marker, descriptor 1..3, travel 6..7, maximum 14..15, ≤9 → 0 and
  ≥max−5 → max in every builder (Ace 68 Pro, Nordic and Ace 60X II builders
  differ only in instruction order / table stride; checked by hand). Nordic 1.07
  takes switch maxima from a RAM table; the runtime 200..600 range check is
  the guard there.
- USB: every image has the same interface-1 descriptor (usage page 1, usage 0,
  64-byte IN/OUT, no report ID) and its PID equals the catalog entry.
- Factory settings in every image: 4 profiles with `AA BB` at bytes 2..3.
- Mix 87 I: `04` also sets a RAM byte that nothing reads; no effect.

Layouts (`layouts_group_a.py`): each official M HUB layout has exactly the
firmware's A0 key set + Fn. Geometry is shared by Jet 75 I/II + Zero75X,
Ace 68 I/II + Air II, Ace 60 Pro + Ace 60X I/II, Mix 87 I + Mix 87 III, so
those reuse one preset with several product tokens (the catalog forbids
identical same-brand presets). Shared preset names were kept so saved
selections of the Supported models keep working. Nordic is a new ISO preset
with a notched Enter (M HUB draws it as one rectangle over the key to its
lower left).

## Implementation

- `mchose_jet75_protocol.h`: 11-model table with keys, reviewed version,
  names, layout identity and `freshFlashReboot`; `ChangeFlag` takes the
  model's reboot rule (older writers keep the normal readback path).
- `mchose_jet75_backend.cpp`: model passed to `LoadMode` / `ChangeMode` /
  `ModeLease`; everything else unchanged (same lifecycle, no version binding).
- Layout tool: Ace 60 and Ace 60 Pro Nordic sources/reports; extra product
  tokens on the Jet 75 II, Ace 68 and Mix 87 III reports
  (`layout_pipeline.py integrate MCHOSE`, backup
  `.local/backups/layout-integrate-hecp4qie`).
- Notice group `MchoseFamily` (flag 33554432, protocol 29): the five MCHOSE
  preset tokens, with Jet 75 II (`0AC93D48E90B5C30`, PID 0x211A) excluded as
  Supported. Banner title "MCHOSE: hardware testing incomplete".
- README / SUPPORTED_HARDWARE updated.
- Backups: `.local/backups/before-mchose-family-2026-10-02.tgz`,
  `build_supported_gap_layouts.py.before-mchose-family-2026-10-02`.

## Tests

- `mchose_jet75_protocol_test`: 11-model table (exact PIDs, no duplicates,
  key counts, ARM/new-core PIDs absent), Nordic/Mix87 I keys, per-model
  reboot rule with readback: PASS.
- `mchose_jet75_session_test`: previous scenarios + Ace68-II + Jet 75 I with
  the fresh-flash bit set (no reboot path, readback, stream, cleanup): PASS.
- No physical test of any model in this table except Jet 75 II.

## Sheet (synchronized 2026-10-02, after the Google Sheets connector was added)

Live `Main`, MCHOSE block rows 526..542 (both families):

- Status → Implemented; awaiting hardware testing: Ace 60 Pro, Ace 68
  (was No usable analog found), Ace 68 Air, Ace 68 V2.
- Renamed and set Implemented: Ace 68 Turbo → Ace 68 Turbo 8K, Ace 75 → Ace 75 8K.
- Inserted Implemented: Ace 60X, Jet 75 (I revision), Mix 87 (I revision), Zero75X.
- Inserted Not investigated: Ace 68 Turbo 16K, Ace 75 16K (so the renames do not
  drop these products).
- Unchanged: Ace 60 (Research incomplete), Ace 68 GT, GOD 60 (Not investigated),
  Jet 75 (II revision) and Mix 87 (III revision) (Supported, green).

Method: fresh native snapshot (`.local/research/mchose-sheet-20261002/
sheet-before.json`, structure PASS), offline plan with
`plan_keyboard_sheet_batch.py` (`plan.json`), applied as revision-guarded
batches (insert + format/validation copied from an MCHOSE model row + 32 px
heights; one value write for A526:C542; border and base-colour repairs
generated by `check_keyboard_sheet_structure.py --plan`). Fresh final read
(`sheet-after.json`): rows equal the plan, `check_keyboard_sheet_structure.py`
PASS (148 blocks, 0 issues), `support_notice_catalog.py --sheet` PASS (281
yellow, live), `check_supported_layouts.py --sheet` PASS (68).
